Example Server-Client interaction application with python

Getting Started

Run server.py with python. Run client.py in another terminal with python. Both scripts set up sockets at the localhost and connect to each other. The file helpers.py uses helper functions sued by both the server and the client. The client.py file can read in a *.csv file with a database and syncs it with the server on startup.

Prerequisites

Python 3.* (tested with 3.8.3)
module socket for python
module pandas for python
module json for python
